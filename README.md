# Pyton-Final-Prjoject
 Final project for CS2021 Python Programming 
 
 Although this has already been turned in, I am choosing to work further on this to see how far I can take it.
 The version on here is the same as the one I turned in. 
 
 I chose to do this project because I've previously tried to do something similar as a web app using JavaScript and HTML (also on my github). I created that program in 2016 when I was less experienced so I wanted to see if I could 1.) do it in pure python and 2.) expand/make a more efficient version of what I did in 2016.
